Problem Statement: Modernizing PatternFly Starter Applications

1. Problem Summary
   PatternFly users lack modern starter application options, hindering development with current industry-standard frameworks like Next.js and Vite.

2. Context/Background
   The PatternFly design system offers a React seed application intended to help users quickly start new projects. However, the front-end ecosystem is evolving, and developers are increasingly adopting modern, faster frameworks over older ones.

3. Problem Description
   The current React seed application is based on a deprecated framework (webpack), which does not meet the needs of developers wanting to use modern alternatives like Next.js or Vite. This forces teams to either use outdated technology or invest significant time building their own starter kits from scratch.

4. Impact
   This technology gap results in:

Increased Development Overhead: Teams spend extra time and resources creating and maintaining custom boilerplate code.
Slower PatternFly Adoption: The lack of modern tooling creates a barrier for new projects considering PatternFly.
Inconsistent Implementations: Without official guidance, teams may implement PatternFly differently, leading to fragmentation.
Negative Developer Perception: PatternFly may be perceived as lagging behind current industry standards, frustrating developers.

5. Evidence
   The need for this initiative is supported by the following observations:

Industry Standards: Competitive analysis and industry research confirm that Next.js and Vite are popular, modern standards for front-end development.
Existing Demand: Internal teams have already initiated unofficial coding efforts to create starters for Next.js (patternfly-nextjs-react-seed) and Vite, demonstrating a clear and immediate need.
Technology Obsolescence: The existing React seed relies on a deprecated framework (webpack), which is no longer the preferred choice for many new projects.

6. Goal/Objective
   To improve developer experience and accelerate the adoption of PatternFly by providing official, maintained starter application options for modern frameworks, including Next.js and Vite, while continuing to support the legacy webpack seed for products that require it.
