# Phase 2: CLI Layout System - Completion Report

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Summary

Phase 2 successfully implements an interactive CLI for generating PatternFly layout components with proper Next.js App Router directory structure.

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ CLI Infrastructure

- Installed dependencies: `commander`, `inquirer`, `chalk`, `tsx`
- Created CLI directory structure:
  ```
  cli/
  ├── index.ts
  ├── generators/
  │   └── layout-generator.ts
  ├── prompts/
  │   └── layout-prompts.ts
  └── tsconfig.json
  ```

### 2. ✅ Layout Generators

Successfully implemented 4 layout generators:

- **DashboardLayout** - Header, sidebar navigation, main content
- **GalleryLayout** - Responsive grid of cards
- **TableLayout** - Data table with search and pagination
- **SplitViewLayout** - Two-panel layout

### 3. ✅ Interactive Prompts

- Layout type selection with descriptions
- Component name validation (PascalCase)
- Optional example content
- Optional route page generation

### 4. ✅ Directory Structure (Next.js Conventions)

Following [Next.js App Router conventions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure), layouts are now colocated in:

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── layouts/          # ← Layout components (colocated in app/)
│   │   └── DashboardLayout.tsx
│   ├── dashboard/
│   │   └── page.tsx      # ← Uses layouts
│   └── ...
```

**Key Change:** Moved from `components/layouts/` to `app/layouts/` following Next.js best practices for colocation.

### 5. ✅ File Protection

- Checks for existing files
- Prompts for overwrite confirmation
- Prevents accidental data loss

### 6. ✅ Build Verification

- All generated layouts compile successfully
- TypeScript validation passes
- Production build completes without errors

---

## Directory Structure Decisions

### ✅ **Following Next.js Best Practices:**

According to the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure), the App Router supports **file colocation** within the `app` directory. Layouts are now properly colocated as siblings to routes.

**Benefits:**

- Components stay close to where they're used
- Clear relationship between routes and their layouts
- Follows Next.js recommended patterns
- Better code organization and maintainability

### Import Patterns:

```typescript
// From a route page to layout (same level as app/)
import { DashboardLayout } from "../layouts/DashboardLayout";

// Generated layouts are siblings to components
src/app/
├── layouts/           # Layouts here
├── components/        # Other components as siblings
└── [route]/          # Route pages import from layouts
```

---

## Key Fixes During Development

### 1. **PatternFly v6 API Changes**

**Issue:** DashboardIcon doesn't exist in v6  
**Fix:** Changed to `HistoryIcon`

### 2. **Page Component Props**

**Issue:** PatternFly v6 Page component doesn't accept `header` and `sidebar` props  
**Fix:** Changed to fragment-based composition:

```typescript
return (
  <>
    {header}
    <Page>
      {sidebar}
      <PageSection>{children}</PageSection>
    </Page>
  </>
);
```

### 3. **Directory Structure**

**Issue:** Initial `src/components/` structure didn't follow Next.js conventions  
**Fix:** Moved to `app/layouts/` for proper colocation

---

## Usage

### Generate a Layout:

```bash
cd src
npm run cli layout
```

### Interactive Flow:

```
? Select a layout type:
  ❯ Dashboard (Header + Sidebar + Content)
    Gallery (Grid of Cards)
    Table (Data Table with Search/Pagination)
    Split View (Two-Panel Layout)

? Component name: (DashboardLayout)
? Include example content? (Y/n)
? Generate route page? (Y/n)
? Route path: (/dashboard)

✓ Generated: src/app/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx
✓ Generated: src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
✓ All files created successfully!
```

---

## Generated File Examples

### Dashboard Layout

- **Location:** `src/app/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx`
- Features: Navigation sidebar, header masthead
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with interfaces
- **JSDoc**: Complete documentation with examples
- **PatternFly v6**: Uses correct component APIs

---

## Build Verification

```bash
cd src
npm run build
```

**Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS**

```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Running TypeScript
✓ Generating static pages (5/5) in 300.6ms

Route (app)
┌ ○ /
├ ○ /_not-found
└ ○ /dashboard
```

## Success Criteria Met

✅ CLI launches with `npm run cli`  
✅ Interactive prompts for layout selection  
✅ Generated layouts render correctly  
✅ Code follows Next.js App Router patterns  
✅ TypeScript compilation passes  
✅ Production build succeeds  
✅ Proper directory structure (App Router conventions)

---

## Known Considerations

### PatternFly v6 Differences

- Some icons changed names (DashboardIcon → HistoryIcon)
- Page component API changed (no longer accepts header/sidebar props)
- All layouts must use `"use client"` directive

### Directory Structure Notes

- Layouts are colocated in `app/layouts/` per Next.js conventions
- This allows layouts to be imported with relative paths
- Follows the "store project files in app directory" strategy from Next.js docs

---

## Next Steps: Phase 3

**Phase 3 Preview: Component Integration**

- Extend CLI to generate individual PatternFly components
- Component discovery from `@patternfly/react-core`
- Generate proper client/server component wrappers
- Handle component props and variations

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 2 is successfully completed!** The CLI generates PatternFly layouts with proper Next.js conventions, full TypeScript support, and comprehensive documentation. All layouts compile and render successfully. ✅

The project now has a working, interactive CLI that follows Next.js best practices for directory structure and component colocation.

**Ready to proceed to Phase 3: Component Integration** 🚀
